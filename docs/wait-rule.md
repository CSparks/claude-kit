## Waiting on builds and tests (KIT-T355)
Cost is per tool call, so a wait is ONE call and one read of the result.
- Run a long build or test in ONE foreground Bash call with a `timeout` of at most 300000 ms (KIT-D104). The harness moves any foreground call to the background at 180 s whatever its `timeout`, so the run must finish in about 170 s. Never start it in the background to wait for it: a subagent cannot idle and its shells end with it (KIT-D115).
- A build or suite that cannot finish in about 170 s is scoped down (a narrower target, one test by name), never given a longer timeout. If it still cannot fit, write a `Handoff` block in the ticket Notes naming the exact command and end; the orchestrator runs it in the background and resumes you.
- A call that returns "moved to the background" outlived that window. Read its output file at most once, never sleep, poll or wait on it: a subagent writes the `Handoff` block and ends, the main thread waits for the one finish notice.
- Pipe the output through a filter that keeps only failures, panics, assertion lines and the `test result` totals.
- Never poll an output file, never sleep-loop, and never re-run a whole suite to see one test: run that test by name.
