## Description
PROCESS FAILURE (stiletto 2026-08-25, orchestrator): launched 3 extra implementation agents in git worktrees (~300-600k tokens each, full cold builds each) without stating scale/cost or presenting the lane plan — violating 'prefer ONE well-scoped agent over several racing ones' and 'calibrate scope before spending; ask before a six-figure-token guess'. Trigger: maintainer pressure ('I hope there's more than that in progress'). Root cause: no gate between a parallelism decision and the Agent tool — the dispatch-ladder hook checks the model, not the COUNT/cost; add a dispatch-budget gate: >1 concurrent implementation agent, or any worktree lane, requires an explicit [allow-parallel: <cost stated>] token in the prompt, and orient restates the rule. Immediate containment: no new lanes; running lanes finish their ticket; next dispatches serial, multi-ticket per agent.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- Each must be a checkable observation. Claude ticks these as it satisfies them.
     EVIDENCE FLOOR (KIT-T061): the closing transition (→review when config.uat: required,
     →done when none) requires this ticket to cite a test artifact — a test path, a suite-run
     reference (npm test / "N passed"), or the fixing commit sha — OR an explicit
     [no-test: <reason>]. The commit gate blocks the close otherwise. -->

## Plan
<!-- filled in before editing; Claude waits for OK if the plan changes scope -->
1.

## Notes
<!-- prose/narrative progress — free-form, direct-edit. Context, blockers, research,
     why a tradeoff was made. Append freely; no format enforced. -->

## History
<!-- structured event log — APPEND-ONLY, stamped by the `t` CLI (KIT-T075). One line per
     event, oldest first. Format: - [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] (event) detail
     events: created | status | comment | decision | blocker | unblocked | fixed | regressed
       (status)    todo → doing            (a transition)
       (comment)   free-text progress / why
       (decision)  what was chosen — cross-cut ones also go in DECISIONS.md
       (blocker)   <title> — open          (unblocked) <title> — <resolution>
       (fixed)     <sha>                    (regressed) → T-040   (recurred as)
     NEVER edit or delete a prior line — this is the task's audit trail (KIT-D037). -->
