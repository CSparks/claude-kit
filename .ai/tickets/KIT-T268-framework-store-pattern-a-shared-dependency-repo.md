## Description
Framework-store pattern: a shared-dependency repo (rapid-game, a git submodule consumed by several games) needs its OWN .ai store (RG key) registered in claude-kit-projects.json, with (a) 't move' across stores leaving a pointer stub in the source store, (b) a 'q conflicts <topic>' cross-scope query that surfaces decisions in different scopes ruling on the same nouns, (c) a commit-gate rule that a decision naming a framework crate (rg-*) filed in a GAME store warns 'belongs in RG'. Root cause seen 2026-08-29 (stiletto ST-D117): 47 ST + 28 HOD + 2 MAR framework decisions scattered across game stores; rapid-game has no store; Chris: 'We can't be making conflicting decisions.'

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- Each must be a checkable observation. Claude ticks these as it satisfies them.
     EVIDENCE FLOOR (KIT-T061): the closing transition (→review when config.uat: required,
     →done when none) requires this ticket to cite a test artifact — a test path, a suite-run
     reference (npm test / "N passed"), or the fixing commit sha — OR an explicit
     [no-test: <reason>]. The commit gate blocks the close otherwise. -->

## Plan

## Notes
<!-- prose/narrative progress — free-form, direct-edit. Context, blockers, research,
     why a tradeoff was made. Append freely; no format enforced. -->

## History
<!-- structured event log — APPEND-ONLY, stamped by the `t` CLI (KIT-T075). One line per
     event, oldest first. Format: - [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] (event) detail
     events: created | status | comment | decision | blocker | unblocked | fixed | regressed
       (status)    todo → doing            (a transition)
       (comment)   free-text progress / why
       (decision)  what was chosen — cross-cut ones also go in DECISIONS.md
       (blocker)   <title> — open          (unblocked) <title> — <resolution>
       (fixed)     <sha>                    (regressed) → T-040   (recurred as)
     NEVER edit or delete a prior line — this is the task's audit trail (KIT-D037). -->
